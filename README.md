# CAWA - Context-Aware Workspace Automator

## Concept
A predictive AI agent that observes your desktop environment and prepares necessary tools/information before you even ask.

## Prototype

### Design Principles
- **Minimalist Glassmorphism**: For a professional, non-distracting OS-integrated feel.
- **Adaptive Content**: Dynamically changing suggestions based on detected context.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations to convey AI "thinking" without clutter.

## Status
